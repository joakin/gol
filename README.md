# game of life

[Demo at chimeces.com/gol](https://chimeces.com/gol)

Because everybody has to implement a game of life once in their lives.

Here's mine. As basic as it can get. (Canvas, ES2015, browserify).

## dev

Clone, `npm install`.

Do `npm start` for spinning up the development server at `localhost:9966`.

Do `npm run build` to run the prod version of the site.
